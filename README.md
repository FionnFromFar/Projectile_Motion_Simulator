This is my first independant coding project as part of a portfolio which will contain many others in the future.
This is a very simple projectile motion simulator and this repo will contain the different versions of the simulator that i will be making over time
I started off with a very easy first project as im trying to get used to using GitHub

The first version contains a very simple modle whcih takes inputs and runs calcualtions to return the time in the air, max height and distance traveled by the projectile
The second version contains a modle which uses the first but adds a graph of the x and y displacements through time

By the end of this project i hope to have a modle whcih uses HTML to make a GUI where the user can use sliders to adjust the launch angle and initial speed and watch the projectiles motion in real time.
